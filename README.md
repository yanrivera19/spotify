# Spotify (clone)

This is a [open.spotify.com](https://open.spotify.com) clone. On the app one can search for songs/tracks, artists, and albums that match whatever term get submitted. When a song, artist, or album gets selected, it will be opened on the spotify website on a new tab. The app was made with ReactJs and the UI styling was done with Semantic UI.

## Page Breakdown

1. **Header:** The header contains the Spotify logo on the right.
2. **Search Page:** The Search Page at first has only a welcome message and a search bar. The user can type in any term and, when submitted, the user will be redirected to another page where the results of the search will be displayed.
3. **Search Results:** When a search is made, the search results are displayed. There are three sections here titled: songs, artists and albums. Each section has a SEE MORE button on display, and a SEE LESS button hidden. When the SEE MORE button gets clicked, the list of results gets expanded and now, instead of displaying five results, fifty (50) get displayed. Then the SEE MORE button gets hidden and the SEE LESS button appears, which when clicked, compresses the list to five like before. Whenever any of the search results get clicked, they will be opened on the spotify website on a new tab.
